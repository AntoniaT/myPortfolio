Over the last two years I have participated in over 20+ projects together with other Designers and Developers. I am educated in User Research and Testing methods, Design Thinking and Front-end Development. However, I recently started to get acquainted with the Back-end too, since it helps my overall understanding of the projects I work on.'

Soon after transitioning to Design and Coding, I knew it was the right place for me, always staying on top of new technologies and being able to bring new ideas to life!'
